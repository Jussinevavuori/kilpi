## What is Kilpi?

Kilpi is an authorization framework for implementing a robust authorization layer in your application.

---

## Philosophy and design principles

Kilpi is designed to follow several guidelines and principles. The aim of these principles is to make Kilpi **easy to use** and **extremely flexible**.

### Centralized authorization layer

Kilpi is designed around a centralized authorization layer consisting of a set of policies, referred to by their keys, such as `documents:update`. Reducing duplicated code makes your authorization logic easier to maintain and understand.

### Policies as code

Policies are defined as code instead of using a no-code interface or a domain-specific language. This ensures type safety, an easy learning curve, and version controlled policies. In addition, policies can be async and fetch data during evaluation for even more flexibility.

### Short and expressive API

Kilpi aims to provide the shortest and most expressive API possible, often aiming for a single line of code to protect an action, mutation, query or UI component. Examples include

```ts
const doc = await getDocument.protect("1");
Kilpi.authorize("documents:update", doc);
```

### Server-side authorization

All authorization checks are evaluated on the server for security, making Kilpi well suited for modern full-stack & server-side applications such as Express, Next.js and many others.

### Framework agnostic

Kilpi is designed to be framework agnostic and can be applied to any technology (with or without plugins). See the installation guides for how to make Kilpi work with your framework of choice.

### Bring your own auth

Kilpi is designed around the concept of a **subject**, which can be used to wrap any auth provider or data source. This means you can even change authentication providers without changing your authorization layer.

### Works with all authorization schemes

Kilpi does **not** implement any advanced authorization concepts (roles, permissions, organizations, memberships, ...), nor does it enforce any single implementation. This enables Kilpi to work with all different applications, requirements, and implementations of the same basic concepts such as permissions.

Instead, Kilpi is designed to be flexible enough to facilitate any authorization model, such as [custom permissions](/docs/advanced/permissions), [ABAC](/docs/advanced/abac), [RBAC](/docs/advanced/rbac) and [ReBAC](/docs/advanced/rebac) using Kilpi.

## Who is Kilpi not designed for?

Kilpi may not suit you, if you...

- Do not work in a full TypeScript (or JavaScript) project.
- Do not require authorization.
- Do not want a centralized authorization layer.
- Require a ready-made no-code interface or a domain-specific language for policies.
- Require an authorization model that provides its own implementation for roles, permissions, etc.
- Are working in a **client-only** application.

## Motivation for Kilpi

I've built over a dozen applications throughout my career. And I've built authorization into them time after time. And I've created half-baked abstractions for authorization way too often trying to refactor countless `if (user.role === "admin" && ...)` statements littered throughout my pages, mutations, queries and UI components.

This has made maintenance troublesome, bug-prone and time-consuming, when new features are added or the authorization logic requires changing.

I knew I wasn't alone.

Kilpi is an attempt to solve this problem once and for all. It aims to be a generic solution to suit all use cases, no matter your authorization needs.

### No expensive lock-in

Many paid authentication services (Clerk, Auth0, Kinde, ...) also offer their own fine-grained authorization solutions.

However, they can be problematic as they lock you in to their product, migrating out of which can be difficult and expensive.

The benefit of using an explicit authorization layer, such as Kilpi, is that you are much less locked in to a specific provider, even if implementing your auth and policies using their SDKs.

### Addressing OWASP top ten security risks

The [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) lists the top 10 security risks for web applications. This library helps you address two of them related to authorization.

- **`OWASP A01:2021`**: Broken Access Control (Listed at #1)
- **`OWASP A04:2021`**: Insecure Design (Listed at #4)

Kilpi offers you a **secure design** for your authorization and by centralizing and making your policies explicit, it helps you avoid **broken access control**, especially when policies change.
