description: Install Kilpi for Next
---

Ensure you have setup Kilpi using the [quickstart guide](/docs/getting-started/quickstart) before proceeding.

### Install plugins

Install the [React Server Components Plugin](/docs/plugins/react-server-components) (`@kilpi/react-server`) to use Kilpi with React Server Components.


**Optional:** Install the [React Client Components Plugin](/docs/plugins/react-client) (`@kilpi/react-client`) for component and hook bindings into `@react/client` on the client.

### Provide a scope for server actions and endpoints

The React Server Components Plugin can't automatically [provide a scope](/docs/concepts/scope) for server actions or endpoints as there is no global request-scoped API. You have to do this manually with `Kilpi.runInScope` to use all Kilpi features, such as `Kilpi.onUnauthorized`.

    The [`ReactServerComponentPlugin` from `@kilpi/react-server`](/docs/plugins/react-server) automatically provides a scope for react server components.

  <Tab label="Server actions">
    Wrap each server action with `Kilpi.scoped` as follows.

    ```ts
    // action.ts
    "use server"

    export const myServerAction = Kilpi.scoped(async () => {
      // Works due to Kilpi.scoped
      await Kilpi.onUnauthorized(() => { ... });
      await Kilpi.authorize(...); 
      // ...
    });
    ```

    Or better, when using `next-safe-action` or similar framework for authoring server actions, you can use the middleware approach as follows with `Kilpi.runInScope`.

    ```ts
    export const ActionClient = createSafeActionClient({})
      .use(async ({ next }) => {
        return await Kilpi.runInScope(async () => {
          // Tip: This is a great place to setup a
          // global error handler for server actions

          // Run the action within the scope
          return await next();
        });
      });
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Endpoints">
    Wrap each endpoint with `Kilpi.scoped` as follows.

    ```ts
    // route.ts
    export const POST = Kilpi.scoped(async (request: Request) => {
      // Works due to Kilpi.scoped
      await Kilpi.onUnauthorized(() => { ... });
      await Kilpi.authorize(...); 
      // ...
      return new Response();
    });
    ```
