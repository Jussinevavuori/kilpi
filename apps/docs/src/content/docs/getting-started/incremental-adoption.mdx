**You can adopt Kilpi incrementally into an existing project.**

Kilpi does not require a rewrite of your codebase to start using. Instead, you can test Kilpi out by moving one policy at a time and by protecting one mutation, query, or page at a time.

To get started, follow the [quickstart guide](/getting-started/quickstart) and define your first policy.

Moving to Kilpi will most likely start making your codebase cleaner and more maintainable, one policy at a time.

If you run into issues migrating any existing applications, you are welcome to [file a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Jussinevavuori/kilpi/issues/new).
