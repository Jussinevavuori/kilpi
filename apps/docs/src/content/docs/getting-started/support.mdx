title: Support development
---

Kilpi is free to use and will always remain so.

## Supporting development

However, Kilpi is currently being developed by a single person as a side-project. This is not sustainable. You can help keep the coffee flowing to receive active maintenance and new features by supporting me for the small price of a coffee.

This is the fastest way to get new features: Improved plugins API, client-side authorization, audit plugin, improved documentation and so much more.
