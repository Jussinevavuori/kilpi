:::note
This is an advanced concept and not required for most use-cases.

Hooks are a flexible API that allows hooking into the functionality of the core library. They are used to customize and extend the behavior of Kilpi.

In essence, hooks are callback functions registered via `Kilpi.hooks.onSomeHook` and called by the core library at specific times. Registering a hook returns an `unregister` function which can be used to remove the hook.

## Types of hooks

This list contains the types of different hooks you can use to use with Kilpi or in your custom plugins.

### `onRequestScope`

When there is no explicit scope available via `Kilpi.runInScope` (or `Kilpi.scoped`), Kilpi attempts to resolve the scope from plugins using the `onRequestScope` hook. It must return a scope object if possible.

```ts
const unregister = Kilpi.hooks.onRequestScope(() => {
  if (isCustomScopeAvailable) {
    return customScope;
  }
});
```

### `onAfterAuthorization`

Called after a policy is evaluated with the authorization result (from `.authorize()`, `.isAuthorized()` or any other function). Only used as a callback.

```ts
const unregister = Kilpi.hooks.onAfterAuthorization((event) => {
  console.log(`Authorization ${event.authorization.granted ? "passed" : "denied"} on ${event.policy} from ${event.source} for ${event.subject.name}`)
});
```
