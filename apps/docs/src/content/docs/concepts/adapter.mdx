title: Adapter

:::tip
We recommend reading about [context](/concepts/context) before reading this section.
:::

Adapters are a way to automatically provide [Kilpi context](/concepts/context) to your application or parts of it.

They implement the `getContext()` method which attempts to return a request-scoped mutable context object.

Note that getting a request-scoped mutable context object automatically is not possible in many contexts, and you must therefore use an [explicit context](/concepts/context#explicit-context) or [alternatives](/concepts/context#alternatives-to-context).

> For example, the Next.js adapter uses the `React.cache` API under the hood to provide a mutable, request-scoped context object. This however has [limitations](/concepts/context#incomplete-adapters).

:::note
In the future, adapters are planned to be replaced by plugins.
