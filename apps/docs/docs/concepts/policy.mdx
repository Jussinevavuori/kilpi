**A policy** is a function that receives a [**subject**](/docs/concepts/subject) and optionally a **resource** and returns an [**authorization object**](/docs/concepts/authorization-object), either granted or denied.

A policy defines an **action** that can be taken in your application, optionally **on a resource**, such as `documents:read`, `users:update`, `comments:delete`.

In a nutshell...

- Policies can be nested as deep as you want, forming a hierarchy.
- Policies always take the subject as the first argument.
- Policies can optionally take in a resource as the second argument.
- Policies can be asynchronous functions and fetch data from external sources for deciding access.
- A policy must explicitly either grant (with `return grant(subject)`) or deny (with `return deny(reason?)`) access.

## Defining policies

Define policies by constructing a `policies` object (with `as const satisfies Policyset<MySubjectType>` for improved type-safety).

<Aside>
The subject type must match the subject type returned by `getSubject` exactly.
</Aside>

```ts
import { deny, grant, type Policyset } from "@kilpi/core";

export const policies = {
  // Example hierarchy
  documents: {

    // Allow all authed members to read docs
    read(user) {
      if (!user) return deny("Unauthenticated");
      return grant(user);
    },

  }
} as const satisfies Policyset<MySubjectType>;
```

### Defining a basic policy

A basic policy takes in a `subject` (often aliased as `user`) and returns an authorization with `return grant(user)` or `return deny(reason?)`.

> The subject is automatically typed by `satisfies Policyset<MySubjectType>`. 

```ts
export const policies = {
  comments: {
    create(user) {
      if (!user) return deny("Unauthenticated");
      return grant(user);
    }
  }
} as const satisfies Policyset<MySubjectType>;

await Kilpi.authorize("comments:create");
```

### Defining a policy with a resource

A policy can optionally receive a **resource** as the second argument.

```ts {3,5,10}
export const policies = {
  comments: {
    delete(user, comment: Comment) {
      if (!user) return deny("Unauthenticated");
      return comment.userId === user.id ? grant(user) : deny();
    }
  }
} as const satisfies Policyset<MySubjectType>;

await Kilpi.authorize("comments:delete", myComment);
```

### Defining an asynchronous data-fetching policy

Policies can even fetch data during evaluation, as they are by design always asynchronous.

```ts {5}
export const policies = {
  comments: {
    async archive(user, comment: Comment) {
      if (!user) return deny("Unauthenticated");
      const response = await getAiResponse("Allow deleting comment: Yes or no?");
      return response.includes("Yes") ? grant(user) : deny();
    }
  }
} as const satisfies Policyset<MySubjectType>;

await Kilpi.authorize("comments:delete", myComment);
```

<Aside type="warning">
If using [protected queries](/docs/guides/protected-queries), do not call them via `.protect()`. Instead use `.unsafe()` to avoid infinite loops. This is safe, as the policy never returns the data to the user.
</Aside>

### Tip: Utility functions

Almost always, your policies will be more readable when using utility functions. See below for examples on how to use utility functions for e.g. data fetching, common denials and more.

```diff lang="ts"
+ const unauthed = () => deny("Unauthenticated");

+ const isAdmin = (subject: Subject) => subject.role === "admin";

+ const isMember = async (subject: Subject, orgId: string) => {
+   const memberships = await db.getMembershipsForUser(subject.id);
+   return memberships.some(m => m.orgId === orgId && m.role === role);
+ };

  export const policies = {
    documents: {
-     async create(user, orgId: string) {
-       if (!user) return deny("Unauthenticated");
-       if (user.role === "admin") return grant(user);
-       const memberships = await db.getMembershipsForUser(user.id);
-       return memberships.some(m => m.orgId === orgId && m.role === "manager") ? grant(user) : deny();
-     }
+     async create(user, orgId: string) {
+       if (!user) return unauthed();
+       return isAdmin(user) || (await isMember(user, orgId)) ? grant(user) : deny();
    }
  } as const satisfies Policyset<MySubjectType>;
```

## Narrowed down subject type

Due to this method of defining policies, the final subject type is automatically narrowed down by TypeScript. You can receive the narrowed down subject type using `Kilpi.authorize` or `Kilpi.getAuthorization`.

```ts {4-5,11}
export const policies = {
  documents: {
    read(user) {
      if (!user) return deny("Unauthenticated");
      return grant(user);
    },
  }
} as const satisfies Policyset<{ userId: string } | null>;

// User is inferred to be non-null
const user = await Kilpi.authorize("documents:read");
//    ^? { userId: string }
```

## Structuring policies

Initially, you can start off with a simple policies object containing all your application's policies. However, as your application grows, so will the `policies` object. At some point, it might be beneficial to split your policies into separate files.

```ts
// policies/documents.ts
export const documentPolicies = {
  read(subject, document) { ... },
  create(subject, document) { ... },
  delete(subject, document) { ... },
} as const satisfies Policyset<MySubjectType>;
```

```ts
// policies/organizations.ts
export const organizationPolicies = {
  read(subject, document) { ... },
  create(subject, document) { ... },
  delete(subject, document) { ... },
} as const satisfies Policyset<MySubjectType>;
```

```ts
// policies/index.ts
export const policies = {
  documents: documentPolicies,
  organizations: organizationPolicies,
} as const satisfies Policyset<MySubjectType>;
```
