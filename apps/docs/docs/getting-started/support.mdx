Kilpi is free to use and will always remain so. I am committed to maintaining Kilpi, as I am using it in multiple production projects. However, developing and maintaining an open-source library "as a hobby" may not be sustainable in the long run.

## Supporting development

You can help keep the coffee flowing to receive active maintenance and new features by supporting me for the small price of a coffee. All contributions are greatly appreciated and help keep Kilpi alive and evolving.
