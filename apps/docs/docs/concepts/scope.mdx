**Scope** is the way Kilpi **stores values scoped to a single request**.

It is used to store e.g. the current `onUnauthorized` handler set in `Kilpi.onUnauthorized`, as well as to cache the current subject.

<Aside type="warning">
  To use certain APIs, such as `Kilpi.onUnauthorized` you must ensure you are calling them within a
  scope. A warning will be logged otherwise.
</Aside>

## Provide an explicit scope

You can provide an explicit scope using either `Kilpi.runInScope` (to run a function) or `Kilpi.scoped` (to wrap a function) as follows.

```ts
Kilpi.onUnauthorized(...); // Will not work, logs a warning

// Using Kilpi.runInScope (runs the given function in a scope)
const result = await Kilpi.runInScope(async () => {
  Kilpi.onUnauthorized(...); // This works
  ...
})

// Using Kilpi.scoped (returns a function wrapped in a scope)
export const POST = Kilpi.scoped(async (req) => {
  Kilpi.onUnauthorized(...); // This works
  ...
})
```

If possible, you should provide scope for each request **using a middleware** or similar.

```ts
app.use(async (_, next) => {
  return await Kilpi.runInScope(async () => {
    return await next(); // Run handler in Kilpi scope
  });
});
```

> `Kilpi.runInScope` and `Kilpi.scoped` use `AsyncLocalStorage` under the hood.

## Implicit scope

Plugins can automatically provide an implicit scope in certain contexts, without having to call `Kilpi.runInScope` or `Kilpi.scoped` explicitly.

For example, the [React Server Components Plugin](/docs/plugins/react-server-components) automatically provides a scope for React Server Components.

```ts {3,7}
const Kilpi = createKilpi({
  // ...
  plugins: [ReactServerComponentPlugin()],
});

export async function Page() {
  Kilpi.onUnauthorized(() => redirect("/")); // Automatically works
  Kilpi.authorize("authed");
}
```

This works by using the [`Kilpi.hooks.onRequestScope`](/docs/concepts/hooks#onrequestscope) hook to automatically create a scope for each request, when no explicit scope is available.

## Not able to provide a scope?

If you are unable to provide a request-level scope for any reason, you can use the following workarounds.

### `Kilpi.authorize` and `Kilpi.unauthorized`

You can't set up request-level error handlers using `Kilpi To use Kilpi.authorize without a scope, you can...

1. **Use the default error handler** provided to `createKilpi` to handle unauthorized requests, and avoid using request-level error handlers with `Kilpi.onUnauthorized`.
2. **Avoid APIs that throw** and instead use manual APIs (such as `Kilpi.isAuthorized` and `Kilpi.getAuthorizationDecision` instead of `Kilpi.authorize`).

---

## Background and motivations

The scope API was designed to

1. **Reduce boilerplate**

   With scope, you optimally only have to call `Kilpi.onUnauthorized` once, and all subsequent authorizations (in nested queries, components, ...) will automatically use the same handler.

2. **Enable caching**

   The scope is used to cache e.g. the subject for the current request.

3. **Enable protected queries**

   Without a "global" `onUnauthorized` handler, you would have to define what happens when a protected query authorization fails. The same query should throw a `HTTPForbiddenError` in one context and redirect to the login page in another.

The primary trade-off of this approach is the **complexity** of having to manually provide a scope or use a plugin adds complexity to installing the library.
