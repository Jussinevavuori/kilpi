Plugins are used to extend the functionality of Kilpi. Plugins can have multiple functionalities.

## Providing scope

Plugins (such as the [React Server Components Plugin](/plugins/react-server-components)) automatically provides Kilpi a scope when rendering React Server Components. This means you can call all Kilpi APIs without having to worry about providing a scope manually.

```tsx {2,3}
export default async function Page() {
  // This just works without `Kilpi.runInScope` with a plugin.
  Kilpi.onUnauthorized(() => redirect("/")); 
  Kilpi.authorize(...);
}
```

## Extending the Kilpi instance

:::tip
No official plugins yet extend the Kilpi instance.
:::

Imagine a `LogRecorderPlugin` which automatically collects logs and allow you to flush them all at once. It's API might look like the following.

```ts
await Kilpi.logRecorder.flushLogs();
```
