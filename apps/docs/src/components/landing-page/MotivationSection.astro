    <p class="text-lg font-bold">I've built a lot of applications throughout my career.</p>
    <p>And I've built authorization into them time after time.</p>
    <p>
      And I've created half-baked abstractions for authorization way too often trying to refactor
      countless <code>if</code> statements littered throughout my pages, mutations, queries and UI components.
    </p>
    <p>
      This has made maintenance troublesome, error-prone and time-consuming, when new features are
      added or especially when the authorization logic requires changing.
    </p>
    <p>Many gray hairs, bugs, and stressful days later, I went looking for a solution.</p>
    <p class="h-1"></p>
    <p class="text-lg font-bold">But there was no solution right for me.</p>
    <p>
      NPM was coming up dry, believe it or not. The few authorization libraries that exist are
      either too shallow, old, unmaintained or abandoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the good solutions are paid authorization-as-a-service products intended for much
      larger applications, not to mention existing authorization systems such as XACML, which are
      way too much for most web applications.
    </p>
    <p class="h-1"></p>
    <p class="font-bold text-lg">Kilpi was my solution to the problem.</p>
    <p>I was aiming for a good abstraction and a good developer experience to solve my problems.</p>
    <p>
      What started off as just another abstraction eventually became its own package in the monorepo
      until it evolved into a fully-fledged library.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turns out, it's a great solution for this! Not only has it made authorization clearer and
      better in my applications, it has also allowed to change my authentication provider with
      minimal authorization logic changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kilpi also helps fight security issues listed in the OWASP 2021 Top 10 Security Risks for Web
      Applications and CWE 2024 Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses reports.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only was it fun to build and a joy to use to solve my own problems, I also wrote my
      master's thesis for Aalto University on Kilpi and authorization in the web.
