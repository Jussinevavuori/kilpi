title: Endpoint Plugin
---

The endpoint plugin is already included in `@kilpi/core`. Apply the plugin in your Kilpi configuration as follows.

```diff lang="ts"
// kilpi.ts
import { createKilpi, EndpointPlugin } from "@kilpi/core";

export const Kilpi = createKilpi({
  getSubject,
  policies,
+  plugins: [EndpointPlugin({ secret: process.env.KILPI_SECRET })]
})
```

The secret can be included in the client bundle.

## Usage

The endpoint plugin exposes the `Kilpi.createPostEndpoint()` function which constructs a web-standard request-response handler function. You can integrate it with your framework of choice however you want. For example, with Next.js you would do the followings

```ts
// app/api/kilpi/route.ts
// (req: Request) => Promise<Response>
export const POST = Kilpi.createPostEndpoint();
```

See [usage on client](/docs/getting-started/usage-on-client) for how to set up `KilpiClient` for calling the endpoint as below including batching, caching, and deduplication.

```ts
await KilpiClient.fetchIsAuthorized({
  action: "documents:delete",
  object: myDocument,
});
```

## SuperJSON serialization

The endpoint plugin uses [SuperJSON](https://www.npmjs.com/package/superjson) for serializing the request and response bodies. This allows you to send complex data types such as dates, maps, sets, and other non-JSON-safe values in the request body and receive them in the response.

## API reference

The API is designed for `@kilpi/client` and is not optimized for calling manually, however it is possible.

### Basic fetch example

The following is a basic example of how you can call the endpoint manually. It includes bearer authentication with `secret` and `SuperJSON.stringify` for serializing the request body.

```ts
import * as SuperJSON from "superjson";

function callKilpiApiEndpoint(body: RequestBody) {
  const response = await fetch(process.env.PUBLIC_KILPI_URL, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.PUBLIC_KILPI_SECRET}`,
    },
    body: SuperJSON.stringify(body),
  });

  if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Failed to call Kilpi API");

  return (await response.json()) as ResponseBody;
}
```

### Request body schema

The request body is serialized with [SuperJSON](https://www.npmjs.com/package/superjson).

For batching purposes, the Kilpi API is always called with an array of items, each one of which has a unique `requestId` and a type indicating the type of the request. Depending on the type, the request may require additional data.

```ts
type RequestBody = Array<
  | {
      type: "getIsAuthorized";
      requestId: string;
      action: string; // Action (e.g. "documents:create")
      object?: any; // Optional object
    }
  | {
      type: "getSubject";
      requestId: string;
    }
>;
```

### Response schema

The response is always a corresponding array of items, with each item having a matching `requestId` and `data` attribute indicating the response data for that item.

```ts
type ResponseBody = Array<{ requestId: string; data: any }>;
```
