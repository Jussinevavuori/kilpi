With Kilpi, there are essentially **two strategies** for protecting and authorizing your application.

### 1. Throw on unauthorized

With APIs such as `Kilpi.authorize()` or `Kilpi.unauthorized()` you can throw when a user is not authorized.

When you have proper handlers setup via `Kilpi.onUnauthorized` to e.g. redirect the user, show a forbidden page or return a 401 forbidden response, this is the simplest and most powerful way to protect your application.

```ts {1,5}
const user = await Kilpi.authorize("my:policy");
doSomething(user);

const user = await Kilpi.getSubject();
if (!user) Kilpi.unauthorized();
doSomething(user);
```

### 2. Manual authorization checks

Sometimes, you have to resort to the non-throwing APIs in use cases where...

- You require more control
- You do not have proper `onUnauthorized` handlers setup
- You do not have access to a scope for setting `onUnauthorized` handlers

In these cases, APIs that do not throw such as `Kilpi.isAuthorized()` or `Kilpi.getAuthorization()` are available.

```ts {1,7,8}
if (!(await Kilpi.isAuthorized("my:policy"))) {
  return null;
} else {
  doSomething();
}

const authorization = await Kilpi.getAuthorization("my:policy");
if (!authorization.granted) {
  return null; 
} else {
  doSomething(authorization.subject);
}
```
