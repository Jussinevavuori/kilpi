**WARNING: THIS LIBRARY IS IN ALPHA -- A WORK IN PROGRESS -- USAGE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

Until version 1.0.0, the API is subject to breaking changes without a major version bump. This is not meant for production use by external users yet. Rather it is an internal project that is being developed in the open.

# Fine-grained authorization

Core package for Kilpi fine-grained authorization. Do not use directly, instead, use with `@kilpi/server`. Additionally, use `@kilpi/client` and `@kilpi/react` if necessary.
