Ensure you have setup Kilpi using the [quickstart guide](/docs/getting-started/quickstart) before proceeding.

Installing Kilpi for Express is as easy as providing Kilpi scope within a middleware. You do not need any plugins.

```ts
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  Kilpi.runInScope(async () => {
    next();
  });
})
```

To handle unauthorized errors in Express, we recommend the following approach with a global error handler **after** all route definitions.

```ts
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  if (err instanceof KilpiError.AuthorizationDenied) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: err.message });
  }

  // Handle other errors
});
```
