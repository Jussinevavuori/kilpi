description: Information on using Kilpi with TypeScript.
---

Kilpi is recommended to be used with TypeScript **with strict mode** enabled. No additional TypeScript configuration is required.

```json
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

<Aside>

Without strict mode, Kilpi is not able to infer types properly and may lead to policies being types as `any`.

<Collapsible title="Not able to use strict mode?">

If you are not able to use strict mode, Kilpi can't guarantee full type-safety.

Ensure you at least have the following options enabled, as without them, Kilpi fails to infer types properly.

```json
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "strictFunctionTypes": true
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```
