title: Authorization object
---

When a policy is evaluated, it returns an **authorization object**. An authorization can be `granted` or `denied`.

If granted, the authorization object contains the narrowed down `subject`. If not, it contains a `message` explaining why the authorization was denied.

This design allows for e.g. subject narrowing.

```ts
type AuthorizationGranted<T> = { granted: true; subject: T; };
type AuthorizationDenied = { granted: false; message?: string };
type Authorization<T> = AuthorizationGranted<T> | AuthorizationDenied;
```

## Receiving the authorization object

To receive the raw authorization object, you can use the `Kilpi.getAuthorization` method.

```ts
const authorization = Kilpi.getAuthorization("example:policy", resource);

if (!authorization.granted) {
  console.error("Authorization denied:", authorization.message);
  return;
} 

console.log("Authorization granted to", authorization.subject.name);
```
