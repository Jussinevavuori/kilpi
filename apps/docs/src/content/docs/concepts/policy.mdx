title: Policy
---

**A policy** (or a rule) defines an **action** that can be taken in your application, optionally **on a resource**, such as `documents:read`, `users:update`, `comments:delete`.

:::note
Internally, policies are asynchronous functions that take in a subject and optionally a resource, and return an authorization object.
:::

A policy in **Kilpi** is defined in two parts, a **subject guard** and the **implementation**.

```ts

// 1. Subject guard
const AuthedPolicy = Policy.as((subject: Subject | null) => subject ? { subject } : null);

// 2. Implementation
AuthedPolicy((subject, res: Resource) => subject.id === res.userId);
```
