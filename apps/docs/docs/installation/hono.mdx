<Step>
### Install and setup Kilpi

Install Kilpi and setup your Kilpi instance by following the [quickstart guide](/docs/getting-started/quickstart).

```ts
export const Kilpi = createKilpi({ ... })
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Handle unauthorized errors from `.assert()`

The `.assert()` method throws an error when authorization is denied.

Since Hono supports throwing HTTP exceptions, handling unauthorized exceptions is easiest with a global `onUnauthorizedAssert` handler.

```diff lang="ts"
  export const Kilpi = createKilpi({
    // ...
+   async onUnauthorizedAssert(decision)  {
+     // Optionally customize behavior based on the decision
+     switch (decision.reason) { ... }
+
+     // By default, throw a HTTP 403 Forbidden exception
+     throw new HTTPException(403, { message: decision.message });
+   }
  })
```

</Step>
