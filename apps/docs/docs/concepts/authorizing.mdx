Learn how to authorize and protect actions, pages, mutations, and more in your application.

## Authorization APIs

Using Kilpi, there are several APIs for performing authorizations. They can all be used to protect your application, with slightly different behaviour.

### `Kilpi.isAuthorized`

The simplest way to check for authorizations is to use `Kilpi.isAuthorized`. It returns a `Promise<boolean>` indicating whether the user is authorized or not. Pass it the action and an object, if the policy requires one.

Unlike with `Kilpi.authorize`, you must also handle the unauthorized case manually.

```ts
if (await Kilpi.isAuthorized("documents:create")) {
  await createDocument();
} else {
  // Handle unauthorized here...
}

if (await Kilpi.isAuthorized("documents:delete", document)) {
  await deleteDocument(document.id);
} else {
  // Handle unauthorized here...
}
```

### `Kilpi.authorize`

In some cases, **throwing on unauthorized** is the simplest way to protect your application, e.g. to automatically always throw a 403 error when an authorization check fails.

`Kilpi.authorize` also takes in the action and optionally an object if the policy requires one.

```ts
// Both will throw if not authorized
await Kilpi.authorize("documents:create");
await Kilpi.authorize("documents:delete", document);
```

### Handling unauthorized errors

Instead of the default behaviour (throws a `KilpiError.AuthorizationDenied` error), setup error handling to automatically handle unauthorized errors.

<Steps>
<Step>
#### Setup a global error handler

Start by setting up a global error handler in `createKilpi`.

```ts
export const Kilpi = createKilpi({
  ...,
  settings: {
    defaultOnUnauthorized(error) {
      throw new HTTPException(403, error.message);
    }
  }
})

// Will throw a 403 error if not authorized
await Kilpi.authorize("documents:create");
```

</Step>
<Step>
#### Setup a handler for each request (Optional)

For more control over your error handling, you can setup a handler for each request using `Kilpi.onUnauthorized`.

<Aside type="tip">
**The error handler is stored in the [current scope](/docs/concepts/scope)**. A scope is required for `Kilpi.onUnauthorized` (a warning will be shown if no scope is available).

See available installation guides for how to set up a scope for each request using your framework of choice.

</Aside>

```ts {3-5}
export default async function CreateDocumentPage() {
  // Any unauthorized error anywhere on this page should redirect to login
  Kilpi.onUnauthorized((error) => {
    redirect("/login"); // Redirect via throw, e.g. in Next.js
  });

  // Will redirect to login if not authorized
  await Kilpi.authorize("documents:create");

  // ...
}
```

</Step>
<Step>
#### Optional: Handle different types of unauthorizations

To differentiate between different types of unauthorized errors, you can provide a `type` while denying authorizations and use the `Kilpi.onUnauthorized` method to handle different types of errors differently.

**1. Deny with `type` (or `metadata`) in denial**

```ts
export const policies = {
  exmaple(user, doc: Document) {
    if (!user) return deny({ message: "Unauthenticated", type: "unauthenticated" });

    if (!user.isSubscribed) {
      return deny({
        message: "Not subscribed",
        type: "not_subscribed",
        metadata: { required_subscription: "premium" },
      });
    }

    return grant(user);
  },
};
```

**2. Handle different types of errors based on `error.type`**

```ts
Kilpi.onUnauthorized((error) => {
  switch (error.type) {
    case "unauthenticated":
      throw new HTTPRedirect(302, "/login");
    case "not_subscribed":
      throw new HTTPRedirect(302, "/billing");
    default:
      throw new HTTPException(403, error.message);
  }
});
```

</Step>
</Steps>

### `Kilpi.getAuthorizationDecision`

Similarly to `Kilpi.isAuthorized`, `Kilpi.getAuthorizationDecision` allows you to manually control your authorizations but returns an **decision object**, with more data about the result of the authorization check.

Granted decisions contain the **narrowed down** `subject`. Denied decisions contain the `message` and optional `type` and `metadata` fields.

```ts
const decision = await Kilpi.getAuthorizationDecision("documents:create");

if (decision.granted) {
  const user = decision.subject;
} else {
  console.error("Unauthorized", decision.error);
}
```

### `Kilpi.unauthorized`

If you want to throw similarly as `Kilpi.authorize` and trigger the default or request-level error handler, you can call `Kilpi.unauthorized`. It works the same way as a failed `Kilpi.authorize` check.

```ts
const isAllowed = await Kilpi.isAuthorized("documents:create");
if (!isAllowed) {
  Kilpi.unauthorized("Unauthorized"); // Throws
}

// Equivalent to
await Kilpi.authorize("documents:create");
```

## Protecting queries

The above APIs can be used to protect all parts of your application, even queries.

Kilpi however offers an optional `Kilpi.query` API for creating **protected queries**. This API allows for co-locating your queries with the authorization logic. Read more below.
