:::note
With Kilpi, you don't have to decide between [RBAC](/advanced/rbac), [ABAC](/advanced/abac), [ReBAC](/advanced/rebac) or other access control models. Kilpi allows fluidly mixing them together based on your needs with a single declarative API. Besides, [RBAC](/advanced/rbac), [ABAC](/advanced/abac) and [ReBAC](/advanced/rebac) are not completely separate models (e.g. [RBAC](/advanced/rbac) is a subset of [ABAC](/advanced/abac)).

This guide is a tutorial on how to implement authorization policies that would fall under the term of RBAC.
:::

:::tip
Before implementing RBAC, carefully consider whether [ABAC](/advanced/abac) or a [Permissions Based System](/advanced/permissions) would be more suitable for your use case as RBAC is often a simplistic approach.

Furthermore, [implementing permissions](/advanced/permissions) instead of roles may allow for a more flexible authorization system, if needed. Roles can be seen as a user-facing abstraction of permissions, instead of an attribute of the user.
:::

Implementing a role-based access control with Kilpi is simple with the `createRbacPolicy` utility, which is an alternative policy constructor API.

```ts
export const RbacPolicy = createRbacPolicy(
  (subject: Subject | null) => { // May optionally be async, and e.g. fetch data
    if (!subject) return null; // Subject narrowing
    return { 
      subject, 
      roles: subject.roles, // Return user's roles as string[]
    }
  }
)
```

The `RbacPolicy` constructor can now be used to easily create RBAC policies with strong typesafety.

```ts
export const policies = {
  documents: {
    read: RbacPolicy("user", "admin", "guest"),
    create: RbacPolicy("user", "admin"),
    delete: RbacPolicy("admin"),
  },
}
```

Due to how the Policy API was designed, the RBAC configuration has to be declared as "Action-to-Roles" instead of "Roles-to-Actions".

We believe this is justified, as most authorization systems quickly run into limitations with RBAC. Let's imagine a new requirement, where documents can be deleted by admins, but also by users if the user created the document. With this API, breaking out of the RBAC model to [ABAC](/advanced/abac) is trivial:

```diff lang="ts"
export const policies = {
  documents: {
    read: RbacPolicy("user", "admin", "guest"),
    create: RbacPolicy("user", "admin"),
-    delete: RbacPolicy("admin"),
+    async delete((user, document: Document) {
+      return user && (hasRole(user, "admin") || user.id === document.ownerId) ? grant(user) : deny()
+    })
  },
}

+ function hasRole(subject: Subject, ...roles: Role[]) {
+   return roles.some(role => subject.roles.includes(role));
+ }
```

With an "Roles-to-Actions" API, migrating to `ABAC` would require a more complex refactoring.
