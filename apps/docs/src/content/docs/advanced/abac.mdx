:::note
With Kilpi, you don't have to decide between [RBAC](/advanced/rbac), [ABAC](/advanced/abac), [ReBAC](/advanced/rebac) or other access control models. Kilpi allows fluidly mixing them together based on your needs with a single declarative API. Besides, [RBAC](/advanced/rbac), [ABAC](/advanced/abac) and [ReBAC](/advanced/rebac) are not completely separate models (e.g. [RBAC](/advanced/rbac) is a subset of [ABAC](/advanced/abac)).

This guide is a tutorial on how to implement authorization policies that would fall under the term of ABAC.

Implementing attribute-based access control (ABAC) with Kilpi is trivial as the Policy API is built to support it.

## What is ABAC?

Unlike [Role-based Access Control or RBAC](/advanced/rbac), which simply defines that a subject is allowed to perform an action based on their role, ABAC alows to customize policies based on **attributes**. These attributes may be related to the user (role, age, subscription, ...) or the resource being accessed (status, owner, ...).

An example of an ABAC policy with several attributes.

> Allow a **user** (subject) to delete (action) a document (resource) if the user is the **owner of the document** (attribute) and the **document is not expired** (attribute) or the **user is an admin** (attribute).

## Implementing ABAC

Implementing the above policy is trivial with the Kilpi Policy API.

```ts
const policies = {
  documents: {
    delete(user, document: Document) {
      if (!user) return deny()
      if (user.isAdmin) return grant(user)
      if (user.id === document.ownerId && !document.expired) return grant(user)
      return deny()
    }
  }
};

async function deleteDocument(document: Document) {
  await Kilpi.authorize('documents:delete', document);
  await db.deleteDocument(document.id);
}
```
