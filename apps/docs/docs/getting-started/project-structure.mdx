The recommended project structure is to start with a `kilpi` directory in your project's source directory, containing the Kilpi instance and the policies and subject definitions.

<FileTree>
- src
  - kilpi
    - policies.ts // Define your policies here
    - subject.ts // Define your subject here
    - kilpi.ts // Create and export your Kilpi instance here

</FileTree>

## Larger projects

As your project grows, you may start extracing policies into their own files, e.g. with a `policies` directory or with a feature-based architecture.

You would then import these policies in a `policies.ts` file or directly in your `kilpi.ts` file.

```ts
// kilpi.ts
import { createKilpi } from '@kilpi/core';
import { organizationPolicies } from './policies/organizations.policies';
import { documentPolicies } from './policies/documents.policies';
import { mediaPolicies } from './policies/media.policies';

export const Kilpi = createKilpi({
  policies: {
    organizations: organizationPolicies,
    documents: documentPolicies,
    media: mediaPolicies,
  },
    // ...
})
```

### `policies` directory

If you'd like to keep your policies centralized, but separate them by domain, you can create a `policies` directory in your `kilpi` directory.

<FileTree>

- src
  - kilpi
    - policies
      - organizations.policies.ts
      - documents.policies.ts
      - media.policies.ts
      - policies.ts // optional
    - subject.ts
    - kilpi.ts
    
</FileTree>

### Feature-based architecture

Alternatively, if you'd like to keep your policies defined close to where they are consumed, you can use the following **feature-based folder structure**.

<FileTree>

- src
  - features
    - kilpi
      - subject.ts
      - kilpi.ts
      - policies.ts // optional
    - organizations
      - ...
      - organizations.policies.ts
    - media
      - ...
      - media.policies.ts
    - documents
      - ...
      - documents.policies.ts

</FileTree>

> Using a feature-based folder structure is recommended for all applications, however even in a feature-based folder structure you may opt to use a `policies` directory to keep your policies centralized.
