title: Endpoint Plugin
---

The endpoint plugin is already included in `@kilpi/core`. Apply the plugin in your Kilpi configuration as follows.

```diff lang="ts"
// kilpi.ts
export const Kilpi = createKilpi({
  getSubject,
  policies,
+  plugins: [EndpointPlugin({ secret: process.env.KILPI_SECRET })]
})
```

The secret can be included in the client bundle.

## Usage

The endpoint plugin exposes the `Kilpi.createPostEndpoint()` function which constructs a web-standard request-response handler function. You can integrate it with your framework of choice however you want. For example, with Next you would do the followings

```ts
// app/api/kilpi/route.ts
export const POST = Kilpi.createPostEndpoint();
```

See [this guide](/docs/getting-started/usage-on-client) for how to set up the client to call the endpoint with utility functions including batching, caching and deduplication, as shown below.

```ts
await KilpiClient.fetchIsAuthorized({ key: "documents:delete", resource: myDocument });
```

## API reference

The API is designed for `@kilpi/client` and is not optimized for calling manually, however it is possible.

### Basic fetch example

The following is a basic example of how you can call the endpoint manually. It includes bearer authentication with `secret` and `superJsonStringify` for serializing the request body.

```ts
import { stringify as superJsonStringify } from "superjson";

const secret = "...";

function callKilpiApiEndpoint(body: RequestBody) {
  const respones = await fetch("https://example.com/api/kilpi", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      Authorization: `Bearer ${secret}`,
    },
    body: superJsonStringify(body),
  })

  if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Failed to call Kilpi API");

  return (await response.json()) as ResponseBody;
}
```

### Request body schema

The request body is serialized with [SuperJSON](https://www.npmjs.com/package/superjson).

For batching purposes, the Kilpi API is always called with an array of items, each one of which has a unique `requestId` and a type indicating the type of the request.

```ts
type RequestBody = Array<
  | {
      requestId: string;
      type: "getIsAuthorized";

      // Indicate which policy to evaluate (e.g. "documents:create")
      policy: string;

      // Optionally provide the resource for evaluating the policy on
      resource?: any;
    }
  | {
      requestId: string;
      type: "getSubject";
    }
>
```

### Response schema

The response is always a corresponding array of items, with each item having a matching `requestId` and `data` attribute indicating the response data for that item.

```ts
type ResponseBody = Array<{ requestId: string, data: any }>
```
