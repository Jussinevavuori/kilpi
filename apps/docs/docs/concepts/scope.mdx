**Scope** is the way Kilpi **stores values scoped to a single request**.

It is used to store e.g. the current `onUnauthorized` handler set in `Kilpi.onUnauthorized`, as well as to cache the current subject.

<Aside type="warning">
To use certain APIs, such as `Kilpi.onUnauthorized` you must ensure you are calling them within a scope.
</Aside>

### Explicit scope

You can provide an explicit scope using `Kilpi.runInScope` as follows.

```ts
const result = await Kilpi.runInScope(async () => {
  ...
})
```

You can either manually wrap individual functions in a scope, or preferrably **automatically wrap functions using a middleware**, for example as follows:

```ts
app.use(async (_, next) => {
  return await Kilpi.runInScope(async () => {
    return await next(); // Run handler in Kilpi scope
  });
})
```

> `Kilpi.runInScope` uses `AsyncLocalStorage` under the hood.


### Automatic scope from plugin

Some plugins automatically provide a scope in certain contexts. For example, the [React Server Components Plugin](/docs/plugins/react-server-components) automatically provides for React Server Components.

```ts {3,7}
const Kilpi = createKilpi({
  // ...
  plugins: [ReactServerComponentPlugin()],
})

export async function Page() {
  Kilpi.onUnauthorized(() => redirect("/")); // This automatically works
  Kilpi.authorize("authed"); 
}
```

View the installation guide for your specific framework or see the list of available plugins.

A plugin scope is always overridden by an explicit scope.

### Alternatives to scope

If you are unable to provide a scope for any reason, you can for example:

1. **Only use the default values** provided to `createKilpi` to handle unauthorized requests.
2. **Avoid APIs that throw** and instead use manual APIs (such as `Kilpi.isAuthorized` and `Kilpi.getAuthorization` instead of `Kilpi.authorize`).

---

## Background and motivations

The scope API was designed to

1. **Reduce boilerplate**

    With scope, you optimally only have to call `Kilpi.onUnauthorized` once, and all subsequent authorizations (in nested queries, components, ...) will automatically use the same handler.

2. **Enable caching**

    The scope is used to cache e.g. the subject for the current request.

3. **Enable protected queries**

    Without a "global" `onUnauthorized` handler, you would have to define what happens when a protected query authorization fails. The same query should throw a `HTTPForbiddenError` in one context and redirect to the login page in another.

The primary trade-off of this approach is the **complexity** of having to manually provide a scope or use a plugin adds complexity to installing the library.
