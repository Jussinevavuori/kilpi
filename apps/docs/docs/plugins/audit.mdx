The audit plugin is used to receive events from the Kilpi server and send them to an external service. This is useful for logging, monitoring and auditing your authorization policies.

The audit plugin is already included in `@kilpi/core`. Apply the plugin in your Kilpi configuration as follows.

```diff lang="ts"
// kilpi.ts
export const Kilpi = createKilpi({
  getSubject,
  policies,
+  plugins: [AuditPlugin({ ... })]
})
```

The audit plugin is designed to primarily work independently after being configured. You however need to configure at the least the `strategy` and `onFlushEvents` callback.

## Configure strategy

Sending every event immediately and separately is not efficient. Instead, AuditPlugin provides several different strategies you can pick to decide how you want to batch and flush your events.

### Batch strategy (Recommended)

**The recommended strategy is batching**. When an event is received, a new batch is started. Every event after that event is added to the batch until `batchTimeoutSeconds` expires, at which point all events in the batch are sent to the external service.

```ts
AuditPlugin({
  strategy: "batch",
  batchTimeoutSeconds: 5,
  async onFlushEvents(events) { ... },
})
```

You can also prematurely flush the current batch by calling `Kilpi.audit.flush()`.

### Periodical strategy

The periodical strategy sends events every `flushIntervalSeconds` seconds (if any).

```ts
AuditPlugin({
  strategy: "periodical",
  flushIntervalSeconds: 5,
  async onFlushEvents(events) { ... },
})
```

You can also prematurely flush the current batch by calling `Kilpi.audit.flush()`.

### Manual strategy

The manual strategy collects all events and waits until `Kilpi.audit.flush()` is manually called by you. This allows for full developer control on when events are flushed.

```ts
AuditPlugin({
  strategy: "manual",
  async onFlushEvents(events) { ... },
})

Kilpi.audit.flush()
```

### Immediate strategy

Finally, primarily for testing purposes, the immediate strategy sends every event separately immediately as they come. Calling `Kilpi.audit.flush()` will have no effect.

```ts
AuditPlugin({
  strategy: "immediate",
  async onFlushEvents(events) { ... },
})
```

### Using in serverless environments

Batching in serverless environments is difficult. You have to ensure that the batch has time to flush and complete before the serverless function dies.

For this purpose, AuditPlugin allows you to pass a `waitUntil` function provided by some serverless environments, such as [Vercel's `waitUntil`](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/functions-api-reference/vercel-functions-package#waituntil) or [Cloudflare's `waitUntil`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/context/#waituntil). Pass it as the `waitUntil` option to the plugin.

All strategies respect the `waitUntil` option.

```ts
import { waitUntil } from "@vercel/functions";

AuditPlugin({
  strategy: "batch",
  batchTimeoutSeconds: 5,
  waitUntil, // Signature: (promise: Promise<unknown>) => void
  async onFlushEvents(events) { ... },
})
```

> Note for Next.js: Using [`after`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/after) is possible however it will only work in RSCs.

## Configure external service

AuditPlugin is fully agnostic to the external service you want to send events to. Connect your audit, logging or monitoring service with the `onFlushEvents` callback.

```ts
AuditPlugin({
  ...,
  async onFlushEvents(events) {
    await fetch(`https://my-audit-service.com/send-events`, {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify(events),
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    })
  },
})
```

### Filtering events

You may optionally filter events using the `filterEvents` option. For example, to only include denied decisions you may do the following.

```ts
AuditPlugin({
  ...,
  filterEvents(event) {
    return !event.authorization.granted
  }
})
```

## Enabling and disabling

You may optionally provide the `disabled` option to disable the plugin.

```ts
AuditPlugin({
  ...,
  disabled: true
})
```

To dynamically enable or disable the plugin, you can use the `Kilpi.audit.enable()` and `Kilpi.audit.disable()` methods.

## Manual flushing

For more precise control on when the current batch is flushed, you may call the `Kilpi.audit.flush()` method to force an immediate flush.

This works with all strategies except the immediate strategy as it does not do batching.

## Logging

You may be tempted to use the AuditPlugin for logging, and it can be done. However, logging authorization decisions using a hook is much easier. See example below.

```diff lang="ts"
// kilpi.ts
  const Kilpi = createKilpi({
    ...,
-   // Logging using AuditPlugin
-   plugins: [
-     AuditPlugin({
-       strategy: "immediate",
-       async onFlushEvents(events) {
-         for (const event of events) {
-           console.log(`...`)
-         }
-       }
-     }),
-   ]
  });
  
+ // Logging using hooks
+ Kilpi.hooks.onAfterAuthorization((event) => {
+   console.log(`...`)
+ })
```
