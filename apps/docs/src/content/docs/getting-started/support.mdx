title: Support development
---

Kilpi is free to use and will always remain so and I am committed to maintaining Kilpi, as I am using it in multiple production projects. However, developing and maintaining a large scale open-source library "as a hobby" may not be sustainable in the long run.

## Supporting development

You can help keep the coffee flowing to receive active maintenance and new features by supporting me for the small price of a coffee. Even small contributions are greatly appreciated and help keep Kilpi alive and evolving.

## Contributing

Kilpi is open-source. This means you are free to contribute. [Clone the repository and create your first pull request on Github](https://github.com/Jussinevavuori/kilpi). Even opening issues and feature requests is a great way to contribute.

:::note
Instructions on contributing to Kilpi are coming soon. For now, you can clone the repository and start creating pull requests.

Help is especially needed in **improving the documentation** and **adapting Kilpi to other frameworks**, such as:
- Tanstack Start
- Vue and Nuxt
- Svelte and SvelteKit
- Solid and SolidStart 
- Angular, Angular SSR and Analog
- Astro
- Fastify
- Fresh
- Elysia
- Ultra
