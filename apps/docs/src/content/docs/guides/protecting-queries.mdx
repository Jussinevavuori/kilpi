In Kilpi, queries are primarily protected with [protected queries](/concepts/protected-query) created using `Kilpi.query`. [Read more](/concepts/protected-query) to understand why Kilpi uses protected queries.

### Create a protected query

Let's take an example query to protect.

> In most cases, you want to ensure the query being wrapped is **pure**, has no side-effects or does not perform any authentication or authorization logic. This ensures the query could be cached (for example with `"use cache"` in Next.js).


```ts
async function getDocument(id: string) {
  return await db.documents.get(id);
}
```

Create a protected query by wrapping the query with `Kilpi.query`.

```diff lang="ts"
+ const getDocument = Kilpi.query(
    async (id: string) => {
      return await db.documents.get(id);
    }
+ )
```

### Add a protector

Next add a a protector. This protector ensures that if a document was found, the user is authorized to read it according to the `documents:read` policy. Otherwise, the protector throws.

A protector is an asynchronous function that **receives the input, output and the subject** as arguments and **returns the authorized output**. If unauthorized to the data, the protector may throw, return `null` (or other), or partial data.

```diff lang="ts"
const getDocument = Kilpi.query(
  async (id: string) => {
    return await db.documents.get(id);
  },
+ {
+   async protector({ input, output, subject }) {
+     if (output) await Kilpi.authorize("documents:read", output);
+     return output;
+   }
+ }
)
```
> If you are using [throw -based APIs](/concepts/protection-basics), query protectors should throw when unauthorized as above. Otherwise, you can use e.g. `Kilpi.isAuthorized` or `Kilpi.getAuthorization` and return `null` or similar to signal unauthorized.

### Call protected queries

A protected query can not be called directly, but has to be called either via `.protect()` or `.unsafe()`. This ensures that the developer intent is clear, and signals clearly to other developers whether the query is being protected or not.

```ts
// Gets the document and runs it through the protector
const document = await getDocument.protect("123");

// Gets the document, but skips the protector
const document = await getDocument.unsafe("123");

// Error
const document = await getDocument("123");
```

### Redacting data

On top of throwing when unauthorized, you can also use protectors to redact or filter data.

```ts
export const getUser = Kilpi.query(
  async (id: string) => {
    return await db.users.get(id);
  },
  {
    async protector({ input, output: user, subject }) {
      if (!user) return null;
      
      // Return full user when authorized
      if (await Kilpi.isAuthorized("users:read", user)) {
        return user;
      }

      // Else return only public properties
      return { id: user.id, name: user.name };
    }
  }
)
```

### Using `Kilpi.filter`

A common use case for queries that return arrays is to return only the entries to which the user is authorized to.

Kilpi provides the `Kilpi.filter` utility for this purpose.

:::note
`Kilpi.filter` must be used with a policy that takes in a resource.
:::

```ts {4,17}
// "documents:read" must take in a document as the resource
const policies = {
  documents: {
    async read(subject, document: Document) {
      return subject ? grant(subject) : deny();
    }
  }
} as const satisfies Policyset<Subject | null>

export const listDocuments = Kilpi.query(
  async () => {
    return await db.documents.list();
  },
  {
    async protector({ output: documents }) {
      // Returns only the documents the user is authorized to read
      return await Kilpi.filter("documents:read", documents);
    }
  }
)
```

### Without Kilpi.query

If you prefer not to use `Kilpi.query` for protected queries, you have to protect your data manually either

1. **In the query function**

    While a simple approach, it has the following downsides:

    - Can't call `getDocument` without authorization.
    - Function is not pure, and can't e.g. be cached.

    ```ts
    export async function getDocument(id: string) {
      const doc = await db.documents.get(id);

      if (!(await Kilpi.isAuthorized("documents:read", doc))) {
        return null;
      } 

      return doc;
    }
    ```

2. **After calling**

    This approach fixes the previous issues, but again, has the following downsides:

    - Authorization logic is duplicated at every place where query is called
    - You may forget to authorize data
    - You may forget to update authorization logic at every place

    ```ts
    export async function getDocument(id: string) {
      return await db.documents.get(id);
    }

    async function Component({ id }) {
      const doc = await getDocument(id);
      if (!(await Kilpi.isAuthorized("documents:read", doc))) {
        return <Unauthorized />;
      }
      return <Document doc={doc} />;
    }
    ```
