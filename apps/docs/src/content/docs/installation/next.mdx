Ensure you have setup Kilpi using the [quickstart guide](/getting-started/quickstart) before proceeding.

### Install plugins

Install the [React Server Components Plugin](/plugins/react-server-components) (`@kilpi/react-server`) to use Kilpi with React Server Components.


**Optional:** Install the [React Client Components Plugin](/plugins/react-client) (`@kilpi/react-client`) for component and hook bindings into `@react/client` on the client.

### Provide a scope for server actions and endpoints

The React Server Components Plugin can't automatically [provide a scope](/concepts/scope) for server actions or endpoints as there is no global request-scoped API. You have to do this manually with `Kilpi.runInScope` to use all Kilpi features, such as `Kilpi.onUnauthorized`.

  <TabItem label="RSCs">
    The [`ReactServerComponentPlugin` from `@kilpi/react-server`](/plugins/react-server) automatically provides a scope for react server components.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Server actions">
    Wrap each server action with `Kilpi.runInScope` as follows.

    ```ts
    // action.ts
    "use server"

    export async function myServerAction() {
      return await Kilpi.runInScope(async () => {
        // Your logic wrapper in scope
      });
    }
    ```

    Or better, when using `next-safe-action` or similar framework for authoring server actions, you can use the middleware approach as follows.

    ```ts
    export const ActionClient = createSafeActionClient({})
      .use(async ({ next }) => {
        return await Kilpi.runInScope(async () => {
          // Tip: This is a great place to setup a
          // global error handler for server actions

          // Run the action within the scope
          return await next();
        });
      });
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Endpoints">
    Wrap each endpoint with `Kilpi.runInScope` as follows.

    ```ts
    // route.ts
    export const POST = async function handle(request: Request) {
      return await Kilpi.runInScope(async () => {
        // Your endpoint...
        return new Response();
      });
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
