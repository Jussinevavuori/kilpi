<Steps>
<Step>
### Install & setup Kilpi

Install Kilpi and setup your Kilpi instance by following the [quickstart guide](/docs/getting-started/quickstart).

```ts
export const Kilpi = createKilpi({
  getSubject,
  policies,
  ...
})
```
</Step>

<Step>
### [Provide scope](/docs/concepts/scope)

To use the full feature set of Kilpi, you need to [provide a scope](/docs/concepts/scope) for each request. This can be done by using the `Kilpi.runInScope` method as a middleware.

```ts
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express';

function kilpiMiddleware(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  Kilpi.runInScope(async () => {
    next();
  })
};

app.use(kilpiMiddleware)
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Handle unauthorized errors

Since Nest.js supports throwing HTTP exceptions, handling errors is straightforward with a middleware.

```diff lang="ts"
  function kilpiMiddleware(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
    Kilpi.runInScope(async () => {
+     Kilpi.onUnauthorized(() => {
+       throw new ForbiddenException();
+     })
      
      next();
    })
  };
```
</Step>
