title: Hooks
---

<Aside>This is an advanced concept and not required for most use-cases.</Aside>

**Hooks are callback functions** registered via `Kilpi.hooks.onSomeHook`. Registering a hook returns an `unregister` function which can be used to remove the hook.

Hooks offer a flexible API for hooking into and extending the functionality of the core library, especially for plugins.

## Types of hooks

This list contains the types of different hooks you can use to use with Kilpi or in your custom plugins.

### `onRequestScope`

When there is no explicit scope available via `Kilpi.runInScope` or `Kilpi.scoped`, Kilpi attempts to resolve a scope from plugins using the `onRequestScope` hook. The hook must return a scope object if one can be created for the current request.

```ts
const unregister = Kilpi.hooks.onRequestScope(() => {
  if (isCustomScopeAvailable) {
    return customScope;
  }
});
```

<Aside type="tip">
If your framework provides an API to hook into a request-scoped AsyncContext or AsyncLocalStorage, you can use this hook to automatically create a scope for each request.

[See for example](https://github.com/Jussinevavuori/kilpi/blob/main/packages/react-server/src/plugins/ReactServerComponentPlugin.ts) how the [React Server Components Plugin](/docs/plugins/react-server-components) uses `React.cache` to automatically create a scope for each RSC request.

#### Type reference

Receives no parameters. Returns a `KilpiScope` object or `undefined`.

### `onAfterAuthorization`

Called after a policy is evaluated with the authorization result (from e.g. `Kilpi.authorize()` or `Kilpi.isAuthorized()`). Only used as a callback, for example for logging.

```ts
const unregister = Kilpi.hooks.onAfterAuthorization((event) => {
  console.log(`Authorization ${event.authorization.granted ? "passed" : "denied"}`);
  console.log(`> Policy: ${event.policy}`);
  console.log(`> Subject: ${event.subject.name}`);
  console.log(`> Source: ${event.source}`);
  console.log(`> Error: ${event.authorization.error}`);
});
```

<Aside type="tip">
  For auditing your authorizations, we recommend using the [Audit Plugin](/docs/plugins/audit)
  instead of this hook. It uses this hook internally.
</Aside>

#### Type reference

Receives a `KilpiOnAfterAuthorizationEvent` object as a parameter.

```ts
export type KilpiOnAfterAuthorizationEvent<T extends AnyKilpiCore> = {
  /**
   * Source (Where was the authorization triggered from)
   */
  source: string;

  /**
   * Policy key to authorize
   */
  policy: string;

  /**
   * Current subject
   */
  subject: T["$$infer"]["subject"];

  /**
   * The resulting authorization object
   */
  authorization: Authorization<InferPolicySubject<T["$$infer"]["policies"]>>;

  /**
   * The resource being authorized
   */
  resource?: unknown;
};
```
