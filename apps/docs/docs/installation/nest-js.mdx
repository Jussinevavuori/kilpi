Ensure you have setup Kilpi using the [quickstart guide](/docs/getting-started/quickstart) before proceeding.

Installing Kilpi for Nest.js is as easy as providing Kilpi scope within a middleware. You do not need any plugins. We also recommend to set an `onUnauthorized` handler to throw an UnauthorizedException with a 403 status code.

```ts
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express';

function kilpiMiddleware(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  Kilpi.runInScope(async () => {
    Kilpi.onUnauthorized(() => {
      throw new ForbiddenException();
    })
    
    next();
  })
};

app.use(kilpiMiddleware)
```
