<Steps>
<Step>
### Install & setup Kilpi

Install Kilpi and setup your Kilpi instance by following the [quickstart guide](/docs/getting-started/quickstart).

```ts
export const Kilpi = createKilpi({
  getSubject,
  policies,
  ...
})
```
</Step>

<Step>
### [Provide scope](/docs/concepts/scope)

To use the full feature set of Kilpi, you need to [provide a scope](/docs/concepts/scope) for each request. This can be done by using the `Kilpi.runInScope` method as a middleware.

```ts
app.use(async (ctx, next) => {
  Kilpi.runInScope(async () => {
    await next();
  })
})
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Handle unauthorized errors

Since Koa supports throwing HTTP exceptions, handling errors is straightforward with a middleware.

```diff lang="ts"
  app.use(async (ctx, next) => {
    Kilpi.runInScope(async () => {
+     Kilpi.onUnauthorized(({ message }) => ctx.throw(403, message));
      
      await next();
    })
  })
```
