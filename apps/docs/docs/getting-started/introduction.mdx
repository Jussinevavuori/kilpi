## What is Kilpi?

Kilpi is an authorization framework for implementing a robust authorization layer in your application — it's designed to help you define your policies and apply them in all parts of a web application.

## Philosophy and design principles

Kilpi is designed to follow several guidelines and principles. The aim of these principles is to make Kilpi **easy to use** and **extremely flexible**.

### Functional Policy-Based Access Control (FPBAC)

...

### Centralized authorization layer

...

### Policies as code

...

### Short and expressive API

...

### Server-first authorization

...

### Framework and runtime agnostic

...

### Bring your own auth

## Motivation for Kilpi

I've built over a dozen applications throughout my career. And I've built authorization into them time after time. And I've created half-baked abstractions for authorization way too often trying to refactor countless `if (user.role === "admin" && ...)` statements littered throughout my pages, mutations, queries and UI components.

This has made maintenance troublesome, error-prone and time-consuming, when new features are added or especially when the authorization logic requires changing.

Kilpi is an attempt to solve this problem once and for all. It aims to be a generic solution to suit all use cases, no matter your authorization needs.

### No vendor lock-in

Kilpi allows you to not opt in to any authentication or authorization provider's proprietary solutions and gives you authorization for free, without vendor lock-in.

It has for example greatly reduced the work required to change authentication providers in a production application, thanks to the `getSubject` adapter pattern.

### Addressing OWASP top ten security risks

The [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) lists the top 10 security risks for web applications. This library helps you address two of them related to authorization.

- **`OWASP A01:2021`**: Broken Access Control (Listed at #1)
- **`OWASP A04:2021`**: Insecure Design (Listed at #4)

Kilpi offers you a **secure design** for your authorization and by centralizing and making your policies explicit, it helps you avoid **broken access control**, especially when policies change.
