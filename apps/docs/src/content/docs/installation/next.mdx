import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Ensure you have setup Kilpi using the [quickstart guide](/getting-started/quickstart) before proceeding.

### React Server Components plugin

Follow the [React Server Components installation guide](/installation/react-server-components) to install the React Server Components plugin and create server components bindings for Kilpi.

### Provide a scope for server actions and endpoints

The React Server Components Plugin can't automatically provide a scope for server actions or endpoints as there is no global request-scoped API. You have to do this manually with `Kilpi.runInScope` to use all Kilpi features, such as `Kilpi.onUnauthorized`.

:::tip
If you are wrapping your server actions or endpoints with anything that supports middleware, you can automatically provide a scope within the middleware. See the `next-safe-action` example below.
:::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Server actions">
    Wrap each server action with `Kilpi.runInScope` as follows.

    ```ts
    // action.ts
    "use server"

    export async function myServerAction() {
      return await Kilpi.runInScope(async () => {
        // Your logic wrapper in scope
      });
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Endpoints">
    Wrap each endpoint with `Kilpi.runInScope` as follows.

    ```ts
    // route.ts
    export const POST = async function handle(request: Request) {
      return await Kilpi.runInScope(async () => {
        return new Response();
      });
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="next-safe-action (or similar)">
    Automatically provide a scope for all server actions using a middleware for your ActionClient as follows.

    ```ts
    export const ActionClient = createSafeActionClient({})
      .use(async ({ next }) => {
        return await Kilpi.runInscope(async () => {
          // Tip: This is a great place to setup a
          // global error handler for server actions

          // Run the action within the scope
          return await next();
        });
      });
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
