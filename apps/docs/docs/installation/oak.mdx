Ensure you have setup Kilpi using the [quickstart guide](/docs/getting-started/quickstart) before proceeding.

Installing Kilpi for Oak is as easy as providing Kilpi scope within a middleware. You do not need any plugins. We also recommend to set an `onUnauthorized` handler to throw an HTTPException with a 403 status code.

```ts
app.use(async (ctx, next) => {
  Kilpi.runInScope(async () => {
    Kilpi.onUnauthorized(({ message }) => {
      ctx.throw(403, message);
    })
    
    await next();
  })
})
```
